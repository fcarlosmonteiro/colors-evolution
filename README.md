# Color Palette Generator for Color Blindness using Hill Climbing Algorithm

This project aims to provide a color palette generator that generates color schemes that are friendly for people with color blindness. The generator uses a hill climbing algorithm implemented in Python, along with the `colormap` and `wcag` libraries for generating and evaluating colors based on contrast ratio.

## Requirements

This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.x
- `colormap` library
- `wcag` library

You can install these dependencies using pip, by running:

```sh
pip install colormap wcag

## Preliminary Results

Here are some preliminary results generated by the color palette generator:

### Input Image

### Extracted Color Palette

### Generated Color Palette

The input image is a sample image that we want to generate a color palette for. 
The extracted color palette shows the colors that were extracted from the input image, 
while the generated color palette shows the colors generated by the hill climbing algorithm. 
As you can see in the preliminary results, the generated color palette is designed to be friendly
for people with color blindness, while still preserving the essence of the original colors in the input image.
However, this algorithm needs improvements to generate representative palettes for the brands as well.
