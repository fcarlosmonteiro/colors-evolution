# Color Palette Generator for Color Blindness using Hill Climbing Algorithm

This project aims to provide a color palette generator that generates color schemes that are friendly for people with color blindness. The generator uses a hill climbing algorithm implemented in Python, along with the `colormap` and `wcag` libraries for generating and evaluating colors based on contrast ratio.

## Requirements

This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.x
- `colormap` library
- `wcag` library

You can install these dependencies using pip, by running:

```sh
pip install colormap wcag
